You are working on an accounting program for an event's ticketing system.

At the end of the day, all the payments received from the payment gateway have to be matched with the users who bought the tickets. There is always a 1-to-1 match between the users and the payments.

Write a function that, given the payment, pricing, and user data, returns a data structure that links the names of the users to their payment IDs, based on the rules described below.

First, orders can be match by the users' emails. If the emails don't match, use the payment amounts. For each payment amount, there will be at most one payment that cannot be matched via the email.

For this problem, we can assume the names are unique.
